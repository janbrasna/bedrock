title: Firefox mobile attribution
---

For Firefox mobile app store referrals we use
[Adjust](https://www.adjust.com/), a third-party attribution system for
mobile apps that is designed to measure, optimize and scale app growth.
We use Adjust tracking links across www.mozilla.org when we link to app
stores for both Firefox and Firefox Focus on Android and iOS. We also
often embed Adjust links in QR codes that we display to desktop
visitors.

To find out more about Adjust, see the following links:

# Adjust link helpers

Whilst they are not used routinely in our pages, bedrock does have a
series of [Adjust link
helpers](https://github.com/mozilla/bedrock/blob/main/bedrock/mozorg/templatetags/misc.py)
that can be used to create Adjust links for different products.
